<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## **Inspiration 📌**

The problems associated with the currently available NFT ecosystem along with our proposed solution can be summarized as:

### Reachability

-   Definition: The ability of the creator to reach the followers.
-   Problem: How does the creator make sure that the followers are within the reach of his/her collectibles and they are indeed being liked by the community?
-   Solution: We make sure that all the relevant information is made directly available in the NFT display itself. This allows followers to reach the creator directly, rather than depending on a third-party source.

### Engagement

-   Definition: The interaction carried out between creators and followers.
-   Problem: How does the creator confirm that the community is actually lively and his/her collectibles in fact, have an impact on society?
-   Solution: We confirm that the followers are able to interact with the NFT and therefore, they are not static anymore.

### Growth

-   Definition: The process of increasing in amount, value, or importance.
-   Problem: How does the creator ensure that he/she does really have the potential of growing and the supporting community is indeed sustainable?
-   Solution: We make sure that the existing NFT owners are able to earn revenue from their NFTs even without listing them for sale.
